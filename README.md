Pylustrator is a software to prepare your figures for publication in a reproducible way. This means you receive a figure
representing your data and alongside a generated code file that can exactly reproduce the figure as you put them in the
publication, without the need to readjust things in external programs.

Pylustrator offers an interactive interface to find the best way to present your data in a figure for publication.
Added formatting an styling can be saved by automatically generated code. To compose multiple figures to panels,
pylustrator can compose different subfigures to a single figure.

Please also refer to the [Documentation](https://pylustrator.readthedocs.io) for more information.
